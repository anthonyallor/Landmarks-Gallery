      <h2>London Eye</h2>
      <p>
        The London Eye was opened in 2000 to celebrate the new millennium. Designed
        by architects David Marks and Julia Barfield, it was originally intended
        to be a temporary structure. Due to its popularity, it became a permanent
        landmark and remains one of the most visited attractions in the UK,
        offering panoramic views across London.

        Big Ben refers to the Great Bell housed within the Elizabeth Tower at the
        Palace of Westminster. Completed in 1859, the clock tower is renowned for
        its accuracy and iconic chimes. It has become one of the most recognizable
        symbols of London and represents British democracy and parliamentary
        tradition.

        the Norman invasion. Over the centuries, it has served many roles,
        including a royal residence, fortress, prison, and execution site. Today,

        and officially became the London residence of the British monarch in 1837
        during Queen Victoria’s reign. Buckingham Palace is now the administrative

      <h2>Tower Bridge</h2>
      <p>
        Tower Bridge was completed in 1894 to improve access across the River
        Thames. Its unique design allows the central sections to lift so ships
        can pass underneath. Combining engineering innovation with Victorian
        Gothic architecture, Tower Bridge remains one of London’s most famous
        crossings.
